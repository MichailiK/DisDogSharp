## Completed Roadmap

<br/>

### Cooldowns for DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands (Completed)

We were planning to add support for cooldowns in DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands. This feature would allow developers to set cooldowns for commands, preventing users from spamming commands. This is now implemented. See [this article](xref:modules_application_commands_cooldowns) for details.

## Future Roadmap

<br/>

### Signed Attachment

We added signed attachments previously but it clashed with other attachment types and broke. We will re-introduce the entity at some point soon.

### DisCatSharp.Voice (Planned)

In the pipeline is DisCatSharp.Voice, set to replace the existing DisCatSharp.VoiceNext. This upcoming version is being designed for enhanced performance and stability in voice-related functionalities of Discord bots, particularly focusing on audio recording. While it promises an upgraded experience for integrating voice features in Discord bots, please note that details are subject to change as development progresses.

### Caching System Overhaul (Planned)

We're contemplating a major overhaul of our caching system, which plays a crucial role in data storage and management for optimized performance. The goal of this proposed rewrite is not just to boost efficiency and reliability but also to add flexibility in how data is handled. This might lead to the introduction of new features and methodologies for data storage and retrieval, though these plans are currently in a conceptual stage.

### Audit Log Functionality Enhancement (On Hold)

Plans are underway to revamp our approach to the Discord audit log API. The intended rewrite of the audit log implementation is aimed at enhancing its functionality and user-friendliness. Potential improvements could include more efficient event tracking, superior data management, and expanded logging capabilities. However, these enhancements are in the developmental phase and are subject to change.

### DisCatSharp.CommandNext Revamp (Proposed)

We are proposing a complete rewrite of DisCatSharp.CommandNext, a module essential for handling text commands in Discord bots. This project aims to elevate the module's overall effectiveness, performance, and ease of maintenance. Anticipated improvements include new features and optimizations that could simplify the creation and management of commands. Please note that these plans are in the initial stages and may evolve.
